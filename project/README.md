## Project Notes:

In order to run the full scene, select the following options on the right side of the screen:
- Garden > Display Garden
- Display Rock Set
- Bee > Display Bee
- Display Grass 

Then, you can use WASD to control the bee:
- W: Accelarate
- S: Decelerate
- A: Turn left
- D: Turn right

Based on what was expected of us, we had the following completion rate in each of the project's components:
1. Sky-sphere (100%)
2. Flowers (100%)
3. Rocks and boulders (100%)
4. Bee (95%)
5. Pollen and hive (50%)
6. Shaders and animation (80%)
7. Additional developments (0%)
