## TP 2 Notes

- In exercise 1, based on ```MyDiamond.js```, we created the requested objects, ```MyParallelogram.js``` (with 4 triangles, to allow visibility on both sides) and ```MyTriangle.js``` (with 1 triangle). After that, we also added the checkboxes to be able to show/hide the objects.

- In exercise 2, based on ```MyTriangle.js```, we created the requested objects ```MyTriangleSmall.js``` and ```MyTriangleBig.js```. We found no dificulties in this exercise.
