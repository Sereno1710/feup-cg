## TP 4 Notes

- In exercise 1 the only difficulty found and that we were unable to solve was the color of the parallelogram, we used the correct texCoords but it is much darker than it was supposed to be.

- In exercise 2 we had some minor difficulty finding out how to bind textures each of the sides. Apart from that, it was very simple
